PROMPTS FOR
AI DANCE MUSIC
@mista.lewys @normalgoodz / Lewys C. G. Evans
Hello and welcome!
Thanks for opening this ebook and your mind to the future of
music creation using text. With this book and a creative spirit, let
your imaginations come alive with artistic and specific prompting
strategies. This book is your backstage pass to the party of tomorrow,
where words can sketch new songs, inspire new horizons of musical
genres and render timeless works of sonic wizardry…
Think of this as your invite to team up with AI and make more music
than you’ve ever imagined. We're talking beats that pulse with life,
rhythms that make your soul wanna dance, and melodies that stick with
you like the best kind of earworm.
We've put together this book because we know music isn't just about
the notes; it's about the vibe, the feeling, and the journey. It's for
you—the producers, the bedroom DJs, the shower singers turned
songwriters, and everyone who's ever felt a beat and thought, "Yeah, I
wanna make that."
Inside, you'll find a goldmine of prompts, like secret ingredients,
that'll help you and AI whip up tracks that could only come from the
wildest parts of your imagination. We're all about breaking rules,
pushing boundaries, and creating sounds that'll make the future dance
to our tune. It's about exploring, experimenting, and creating tunes
that feel like they’re from 3024.
