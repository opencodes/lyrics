After devoting a decade to various sectors such as Finance, Consulting Services, E-Commerce, and Teaching, we found ourselves longing for a refreshing change.
Eager to renew and energize our spirits, we sought out something captivating to reignite our passion.

From the depths of our hearts, we began distilling ideas, much like waterâ€”initially colorless and transparent. As thoughts bubbled to the surface of our minds, fueled by the heat of ideation, before they evaporate within a span of time.

Jot down your thoughts on the creamy white pages, allowing your ideas to swirl and blend like milk in a cup.

Yet, it lacked flavor and vibrancy. So, we infused it with colors to enhance its appeal, much like adding tea leaves to tea or the zest of ginger to enrich its content.

Now that the final content is prepared, we serve it up in various vessels, molding it into different shapes and sizes like poetry, podcasts, and unfolding processes depicted in how-to videos.

Let's gather together and share a cup of tea, as we contemplate the wonders of the universe through our own eyes.

Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We look forward to continuing our journey, telling stories in various formats inspired by the beauty of this universe.
