[Intro]
[Deep, Soulful Male Voice] (oh-oh-oh)
[Deep, Soulful Male Voice] (ooh-yeah)

[Short Instrumental Intro]

[Catchy Hook]

Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall
The pain within my heart, don't let it show on my face

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
What will you gain by coming out?
You'll just stand silently
Blocked forever
You won't be able to say anything

[Pre Chorus]
Don't let the few joys outside fade away

[Chorus]
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Whenever you come, be tears of joy on the eyelids
Be like the life-giving nectar, be the steady flame in the burning lamp
[Melodic Interlude]
[Pre Chorus]
Be the life's light like nectar, let it flow for some more time

[Chorus]
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall

[Verse 3]
Become as calm as the surface of the ocean, hold the waves beneath you
Let go of enmity and heavy breaths, the paths have gone astray

[Melodic Interlude]
[Pre Chorus]
Desire, aspirations, wishes
Let them remain unbroken, uninterrupted
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall

[Chorus]
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall
[Melodic Interlude]

[Outro]
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall
Oh, eyes, don't let the tears fall
[Fade Out and End]
