[Intro]
[Short Instrumental Intro]
[Catchy Hook]
How can I express what she will be like?

[Instrumental]
[Verse 1 ]
Never read about her in tales,
Never witnessed her graceful sails,
Unknown, she remains, like hidden veils,

[Chorus]
How can I express what she will be like?
[Break]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2 ]
Unseen, yet a mystery untold,
Her essence, a story yet to unfold,
She's like a myth, wrapped in gold,

[Chorus]
How can I express what she will be like?

[Break]

[Instrumental]
[Verse 3 ]
In her eyes, secrets reside,
A universe within, where dreams glide,
Like an enigma, she hides her guide,

[Chorus]
How can I express what she will be like?
[Break]
[Instrumental]


[Verse 4 ]
Untouched by knowledge's reign,
Her essence, beyond my brain's terrain,
Elusive, like an uncaught rain,

[Chorus]
How can I express what she will be like?

[Break]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 5 ]
She's a tale I've yet to read,
A riddle unsolved, a mystery to heed,
In her silence, she plants her seed,

[Chorus]
How can I express what she will be like?

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Smile
