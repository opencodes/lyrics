[Intro]
[woman] (oh-oh-oh)
[woman](ooh-yeah)

(Verse 1)
In the glow of screens, where legends rise,
We embark on quests beneath digital skies.
With controllers in hand, and hearts full of fire,
We journey forth, fueled by our desire.

[melodic interlude]
[Pre Chorus]
We are the gamers, masters of the screen,
In the world of pixels, we reign supreme.
[Chorus]
From dawn till dusk, we fight as one,
In this endless adventure, our quest's just begun.

[melodic interlude]
(Verse 2)
Through dungeons deep and mountains high,
We'll never falter, we'll never sigh.
With comrades by our side, we'll face the unknown,
For in this digital world, we've truly grown.

[melodic interlude]
[Pre Chorus]
We are the gamers, masters of the screen,
In the world of pixels, we reign supreme.
[Chorus]
From dawn till dusk, we fight as one,
In this endless adventure, our quest's just begun.

[Rap verse]
From 8-bit dreams to worlds in HD,
We'll write our story for all to see.
With passion as our guide, and courage as our sword,
We'll journey on, forever forward.

[melodic interlude]
[Pre Chorus]
We are the gamers, masters of the screen,
In the world of pixels, we reign supreme.
[Chorus]
From dawn till dusk, we fight as one,
In this endless adventure, our quest's just begun.

[Rap verse]
So raise your controllers, let the games begin,
For in this world of pixels, we'll always win.
