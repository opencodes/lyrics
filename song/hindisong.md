[Intro]
[woman] (oh-oh-oh)
[woman](ooh-yeah)

[Verse]
No dear friend by my side, no comforting hand to hold,
Alone I walk this path, no one to call my own.

[Chorus]
No dear friend by my side, no comforting hand to hold,

[Verse]
In the quiet of the evening, how will I find my way?
The guiding star has vanished, leaving me astray.

[Chorus]
No dear friend by my side, no comforting hand to hold,

[Verse]
Oh, eyes, don't laugh, I won't find solace in your gaze,
We can't be together, our paths won't intertwine.

[Chorus]
No dear friend by my side, no comforting hand to hold,

[Verse]
What can I say? Where do I aimlessly wander?
The gesture to beckon me back, it's lost, it's gone.

[Chorus]
No dear friend by my side, no comforting hand to hold


[After an intense interlude, the song ends]
[End]
